# RegNet_with_BiFPN
RegNet with BiFPN was created by refering the Yet Another EfficientDet. 
EfficientDet was created by using EfficientNet. 
This Backbone was replaced by RegNet. 
Implementation of RegNet which builds on ResNet by adding an RNN-Regulator Module to preserve the spatio-temporal data between residual blocks.
